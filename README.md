<b>Goal</b>

This project can be broken down into two distinctive parts:<br>
• The assembler: this is the program that will compile your champions and translate them from the language you will write them in (assembly language) into “Bytecode”.Bytecode is a machine code, which will be directly interpreted by the virtual
machine.<br>
• The virtual machine: It’s the “arena” in which your champions will be executed.
It offers various functions, all of which will be useful for the battle of the champions.
Obviously, the virtual machine should allow for numerous simultaneous processes;
we are asking you for a gladiator fight, not a one-man show simulator.

<b>The assembler</b>

Your virtual machine will execute a machine code (or “bytecode”) that will be
generated by your assembler. The assembler (the program) will get a file written in
assembly language as argument and generate a champion that will be understood
by the virtual machine.<br>
• It will run like that:<br>
   ./asm mychampion.s<br>
• It will read the assembly’s code processed from the file .s given as argument, and
write the resulting bytecode in a file named same as the argument by replacing the
extension .s by .cor.<br>
• In case of an error, you will need to display a relevant message on the standard
error output and not create the .cor file.<br>
